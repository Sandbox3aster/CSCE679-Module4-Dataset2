## College Scorecard Data

College Scorecard provides data at the institution-level and data by field of study in the United States. The technical data documents provide in-depth information about these data. The data dictionary includes separate worksheets with institution-level and field of study dictionaries as well as cohort maps describing the timing aspects of each data element.

The data was truncated by me and it contains the following information such as
College Name, City, States, Website, Zip Code, Latitude, Longitude
